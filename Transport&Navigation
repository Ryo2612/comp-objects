A benefit of computer vision for the transport and navigation scetor would be recognising the images of objects on a car camera for example.
This is beneficial in case an object gets in the way of the car or comes to close, the car would be reminded that soething is nearby preventing accidents from occuring.
A limitation would be detecting small objects, such as a small animal may not be detected. 
A risk being the fact that an accident may occur.
