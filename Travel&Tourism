A beneift of fast image recongition for the tourism sector is recognising a famous landmarks for example giving the viewer the name of it instantly.
A limitation would be that the fast recognition may not be advanced enough to translate language to fit your home langauge- making it difficult for the viewer to identify 
the building or landmark.
A potential risk would be that the viewer has to guess what building it is potentially confusing it with another building.
